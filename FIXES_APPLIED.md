# Option Pricing Implementation - Fixes Applied

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Fixed Compilation Issues
- **Problem**: Code had undefined variables (`num_simulations`, `geometric_brownian_motion`), missing includes, and broken method calls
- **Solution**: 
  - Completely restructured the Monte Carlo simulation logic
  - Implemented proper random number generation using `std::mt19937` and `std::normal_distribution`
  - Fixed all undefined references and missing includes
  - Created proper separation between option pricing logic and simulation methods

### 2. ✅ Implemented Proper Asian Option Pricing
- **Problem**: Asian option was incorrectly implemented as European (using only final price)
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented true path-dependent pricing using arithmetic averaging
  - Generate full GBM paths with multiple time steps
  - Calculate payoff based on average price over the entire path
  - Added support for both Asian call and put options

### 3. ✅ Added Comprehensive Input Validation and Error Handling
- **Problem**: No validation of input parameters
- **Solution**:
  - Added validation in base `Option` class constructor
  - Validates: S0 > 0, K > 0, r ≥ 0, σ ≥ 0, T > 0
  - Added reasonable upper bounds (T ≤ 10 years, σ ≤ 500%)
  - Option type validation ('C' or 'P' only)
  - Proper exception handling with descriptive error messages
  - Try-catch blocks in main function

### 4. ✅ Implemented Proper Random Number Generation
- **Problem**: Missing `random_normal()` function
- **Solution**:
  - Used modern C++ `<random>` library
  - `std::mt19937` Mersenne Twister generator for high-quality randomness
  - `std::normal_distribution<double>` for standard normal variates
  - Seed management with `setSeed()` method for reproducible results
  - Automatic seeding using system clock

### 5. ✅ Added Analytical Pricing Methods for Verification
- **Problem**: No way to verify Monte Carlo results
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented Black-Scholes analytical formula for European options
  - Added cumulative normal distribution function (Abramowitz & Stegun approximation)
  - Both call and put option formulas
  - Verification through comparison with Monte Carlo results
  - Put-call parity verification in main program

## Usage Examples

```cpp
try {
    EuropeanOption call(100.0, 100.0, 0.05, 0.2, 1.0, 'C');
    double mc_price = call.price();           
    double bs_price = call.blackScholesPrice(); 
    
    AsianOption asian(100.0, 100.0, 0.05, 0.2, 1.0, 'C');
    double asian_price = asian.price();       
    
    MonteCarlo mc(50000, 252);  
    mc.setSeed(42);             
    double custom_price = mc.simulateEuropean(100, 100, 0.05, 0.2, 1.0, 'C');
    
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cout << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

## Compilation Instructions

```bash
# Using g++ (Linux/Mac/MinGW on Windows)
g++ -std=c++11 -I include src/*.cpp -o option_pricing

# Using make
make

# Using Microsoft Visual C++ (Windows)
cl /EHsc /I include src\*.cpp /Fe:option_pricing.exe
```

## Testing

The program now includes:
